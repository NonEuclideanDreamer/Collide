Java Project simulating Collision between objects.

Objects move around. When two objects overlap the recoil from each other. One can also turn on gravity and air friction.

Collide.java is the class containing the main method. It produces picture files that can be put together into a video.
Object.java describes the objects. So far I implemented (hollow) circles, disks, squares and walls. I implement the interaction between these and how to draw them.
VG.java is a auxiliary class implementing vector geometry methods on arrays acting as vectors or matrices.
